Responsive WordPress Starter Theme
==================================

This theme is a hybrid theme created from Underscores (_s) http://underscores.me/ and Gridiculous http://gridiculo.us/. I created this for my personal use because I love _s, but wanted a responsive grid built in.

This is truly a bare bones theme - minimal styling and no code bloat. It's a great starting point for creating your own custom themes.

The modifications:
* added gridiculous responsive grid
* added grid classes to all template files
* enabled post thumbnails (in functions.php)
* enabled custom header image (in functions.php)
* added html5 shiv for IE8 support (enqueued in functions.php)

More about the theme from _s documentation:

* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
* A helpful 404 template.
* A sample custom header implementation in `inc/custom-header.php` that can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php and adding the code snippet found in the comments of `inc/custom-header.php` to your `header.php` template.
* Custom template tags in `inc/template-tags.php` that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.
* Some small tweaks in `inc/extras.php` that can improve your theming experience.
* A script at `js/navigation.js` that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for CSS artistry. It's enqueued in `functions.php`.
* 2 sample CSS layouts in `layouts` for a sidebar on either side of your content.
* Smartly organized starter CSS in `style.css` that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.
* Licensed under GPLv2 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.

Refer to http://gridiculo.us/ to learn how to use the grid on your site.

Please note: I am not offering support of this theme. I've simply shared it here for anyone who would like to use it. If you find a bug, please create an issue.

Happy theming!
